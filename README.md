# Flix

Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

We build the first part of a movie browsing app--similar to Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes--that lets a user view and scroll through a list of movies. To do this, we get data from the internet (via an API) and display it in a scrollable list in our app

we'll be extending our Flicks app to allow users to get more information about a particular movie in a movie details screen. Then, we'll add a tab bar to allow users to view movies in a grid view (Collection View) from different endpoints of the MovieDB API.
